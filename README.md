This is the README file for the Duplicate File Finder script, a Python script that helps you find and manage duplicate files on your computer.

Features:

Scans a specified directory and its subdirectories for duplicate files.
Identifies duplicates based on file content (SHA-256 hash).
Allows you to specify minimum and maximum file sizes to filter results.
Lets you include or exclude specific file types by extension.
Provides options to move or delete duplicate files.
Generates a report of all found duplicates.
How to Use:

Download the script: Save the script as duplicate_file_finder.py on your computer.
Install dependencies: Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed: tkinter, json, hashlib, shutil, mimetypes, csv, datetime, concurrent.futures, and progress. You can install them using pip install <library_name>.
Run the script: Open a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you saved the script, and run the following command: python duplicate_file_finder.py.
Configure settings: The script will open a graphical user interface (GUI) where you can specify various options, such as starting path, duplicates folder, file size limits, file types, and deletion preference.
Start processing: Click the "Process Files" button to start searching for duplicates. The script will display progress information and results in the GUI.
Review report: After processing is complete, you can find a report of all found duplicates in a CSV file named duplicate_report.csv.
Additional Notes:

You can save and load your settings for future use.
The script provides basic feedback through the GUI, but you can also enhance it with more detailed logging or error reporting.
Consider adding more features like file name comparisons, previewing duplicates, or offering different sorting options for the report.
I hope this README helps you get started with the Duplicate File Finder script!
